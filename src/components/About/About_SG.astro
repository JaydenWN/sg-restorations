        <h2>About SG Restorations</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            SG Restorations is a small family run business proudly serving the
            Central Coast, Newcastle and Sydney. We specialise in mould removal,
            moisture remediation and property restoration with a focus on
            honesty, reliability and care.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            After years working in a large corporate restoration company, Steve
            decided it was time to do things differently. He set out to build a
            business where people come first, not profit margins. At SG
            Restorations, every job is personal. We take the time to explain the
            issue, walk you through the solution and treat your home with the
            same respect we would our own.
        </p>

            it puts your family's health at risk. That is why we show up on
            time, communicate clearly and work thoroughly to restore comfort,
            safety and peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
