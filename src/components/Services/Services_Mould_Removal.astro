        <h2>Central Coast Mould Removal and Remediation</h2>
        <p>
            Mould can damage your property and impact your health if left
            untreated. At SG Restorations, we identify the source of the
            problem, safely remove all traces of mould, and apply professional
            remediation techniques to help prevent it from coming back. We take
            a thorough and certified approach to ensure your home or workplace
            is safe, dry and mould free.
